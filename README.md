# machuruku
Machuruku is an R package developed with [Wilson X. Guillory](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a_n1uCIAAAAJ&hl=en) for phylogenetic niche modeling.  Machuruku estimates ancestral distributions based on ancestral niche reconstructions and niche-modeling.  The most update version of this is hosted on Wilson's Github: https://github.com/wxguillo/machuruku.  

To install Machuruku, simply run the following in R:
```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("wxguillo/machuruku")
```
For both quick and detailed tutorials on how to use Machuruku, please visit the [tutorial page](https://github.com/wxguillo/machuruku/tree/main/tutorial) in this repository.
